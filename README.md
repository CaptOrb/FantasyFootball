# FantasyFootball
A simple application to implement a Fantasy Football system where users can keep track with how their team is doing on a two week basis

Users are asked to enter information about every player (e.g. how many times they scored on a particular week) and then the program
ranks the players in the team from the player who achieved the most points down to the player that received the fewest points during the course of the week

Points are awarded to each football player as follows:


* 2 points for playing the game
* 5 points for every goal the player scores
* 3 points for every goal the player assists
* -3 points for every penalty the player misses
* -1 point for a yellow card
* -3 points for a red card
* 5 points for the player who is the "Man of the match"
